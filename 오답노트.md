B. Configure AWS ElastiCache for Redis to offload direct requests to the servers.
C. Configure an Auto Scaling step scaling policy with an instance warmup condition.
D. Configure Amazon CloudFront to use an Application Load Balancer as the origin.

B. Use EC2 metadata to collect information, then publish it to Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics. Monitor Swap Usage metrics in CloudWatch.
C. Install an Amazon CloudWatch agent on the instances. Run an appropriate script on a set schedule. Monitor Swap Utilization metrics in CloudWatch.
D. Enable detailed monitoring in the EC2 console. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Swap Utilization custom metric. Monitor Swap Utilization metrics in CloudW

### 잠깐!
- nlb에 비해 7계층까지 확인하는 alb의 기능이 더 많다.
- nlb는 고정 IP 지원 -> 방하벽
- 그러나, nlb는 network 계층까지만 확인하므로 alb 보다 빠르다. 따라서 단순한 라우팅이 필요하고, 트래픽이 극도로 많은 경우에는 alb 보다는 nlb를 사용하는 것이 적합하다.
- alb는 path-based routing이 가능하므로 path를 확인하여 특정 서버로 라우팅을 시켜주어야 하는 경우에 적합하다 (api gw)

A company currently has 250 TB of backup files stored in Amazon S3 in a vendor's proprietary format. Using a Linux-based software application provided by the vendor, the company wants to retrieve files from Amazon S3, transform the files to an industry-standard format, and re-upload them to Amazon S3. The company wants to minimize the data transfer charges associated with this conversation.
What should a solution architect do to accomplish this?

A. Install the conversion software as an Amazon S3 batch operation so the data is transformed without leaving Amazon S3.
B. Install the conversion software onto an on-premises virtual machine. Perform the transformation and re-upload the files to Amazon S3 from the virtual machine.
C. Use AWS Snowball Edge device to expert the data and install the conversion software onto the devices. Perform the data transformation and re-upload the files to Amazon S3 from the Snowball Edge devices.
D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in the same Region as Amazon S3 and install the conversion software onto the instance. Perform the transformation and re- upload the files to Amazon S3 from the EC2 instance.

### No.5
A company hosts its core network services, including directory services and DNS, in its on promises data center. The data center is connected to the AWS Cloud using AWS Direct Connect (DX). Additional AWS accounts are planned that will require quick, cost-effective, and consistent access to these network services.
What should a solutions architect implement to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Create a DX connection in each new account. Route the network traffic to the on-premises servers.
B. Configure VPC endpoints in the DX VPC for all required services. Route the network traffic to the on-premises servers.
C. Create a VPN connection between each new account and the DX VPC. Route the network traffic to the on-premises servers.
D. Configure AWS Transit Gateway between the accounts. Assigns DX to the transit gateway and route network traffic to the on-premises servers.

### No.6
A-company receives structured and semi-structured data from various sources once every day. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that leverages big data processing frameworks. The data should be accessible using SQL queries and business intelligence tools.
What should the solutions architect recommend to build the MOST high-performing solution?

A. Use AWS Glue to process data and Amazon S3 to store data.
B. Use Amazon EMR to process data and Amazon Redshift to store data.
C. Use Amazon EC2 to process data and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) to store data.
D. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to process data and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to store data.

`Answer : B, Big data EMR, Redshift for analyzing`

### No.7
A solutions architect is creating an application that will handle batch processing of large amounts of data. The input data will be held in Amazon S3 and the output data will be stored in a different S3 bucket. For processing, the application will transfer the data over the network between multiple Amazon EC2 instances.

A. Place all the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.
B. Place all the EC2 instances in the same AWS Region.
C. Place all the EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone.
D. Place all the EC2 instances in private subnets in multiple Availability Zones.

`Answer B : There is no data transfer cost between EC2 & S3 with in same region.`
